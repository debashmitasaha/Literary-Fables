The project involves developing a comprehensive database for a book marketplace that allows users to buy, borrow, and exchange books. The platform supports multiple user roles, including bookshops, publishers, and libraries, each with distinct functionalities.

Users can purchase books from bookshops, borrow books from libraries using library cards, and exchange books with other users.
Bookshops can sell books to users or exchange books with them.
Libraries can lend books to users, with borrowing facilitated through library cards.
Publishers supply books to bookshops and libraries, enabling broader distribution.
Additionally, the platform offers subscription-based services and statistical insights to enhance user experience. Gift cards provide discounts on book purchases, while library cards facilitate borrowing.

This database system is designed to efficiently manage transactions, user interactions, and inventory while ensuring a seamless experience for all participants in the ecosystem.
